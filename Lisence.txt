1-This app was built by beginner-level programmers, so you might encounter some bugs or issues.

2-This app works similarly to ransomware (not sure how to spell it), but in a good way, allowing you to protect your files from curious kids or even your wife.

3-IMPORTANT: Always remember your password! If you forget it, you will lose access to your files forever.

4-This app was made by Abdo Raz (Project Leader - BEDFTB) and Zaid Alsalh (Project Co-Leader - FEDFTB - UI).
