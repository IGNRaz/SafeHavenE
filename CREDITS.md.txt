# Disclaimer

This app was built by beginner-level programmers, so you might encounter some bugs or issues.

This app works similarly to ransomware (not sure how to spell it), but in a good way, allowing you to protect your files from curious kids or even your wife.

IMPORTANT: Always remember your password! If you forget it, you will lose access to your files forever.
